## 🎯 Description
Implement API integration layer using React Query for data fetching, mutations, and caching

## 📝 Implementation Details
Set up React Query v5 with QueryClientProvider. Create custom hooks for common API operations (useUsers, useCompany, useLeads). Implement optimistic updates for mutations. Set up proper error handling with error boundaries. Configure caching strategies for different data types. Implement automatic refetching on window focus. Create interceptors for handling authentication tokens. Add retry logic for failed requests. Implement pagination and infinite scrolling utilities. Use TypeScript for type-safe API responses.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test API hooks with mock server responses. Verify caching behavior works as expected. Test error handling for failed requests. Verify optimistic updates for mutations. Test pagination and infinite scrolling functionality.
