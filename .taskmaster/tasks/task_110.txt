# Task 110: Implement Bundle Splitting and Lazy Loading

## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 110
- **Title**: Implement Bundle Splitting and Lazy Loading
- **Status**: ⏳ pending
- **Priority**: 🟡 medium
- **Dependencies**: None ✅ Ready to start

## 🎯 Description
Optimize application performance by implementing code splitting, bundle optimization, and lazy loading.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Configure webpack or other bundler for code splitting. Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for component-level code splitting. Set up dynamic imports for route-based code splitting. Analyze bundle size using tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer. Optimize dependencies by removing unused packages and using smaller alternatives where possible. Implement tree shaking to eliminate dead code. Set up module/nomodule pattern for modern/legacy browser support. Configure long-term caching with content hashing.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Measure bundle sizes before and after optimization. Verify lazy loading works by monitoring network requests during navigation. Test application performance on low-end devices and slow connections. Use Lighthouse to measure performance improvements. Ensure functionality remains intact after optimizations.
