Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation throughout the calculator interface. Ensure all interactive elements can be reached and activated using Tab, Enter, Space, and arrow keys. Create a logical tab order that follows the visual flow of the interface. Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions (next/previous step, submit, etc.). Add focus trapping for modal dialogs and other contained interfaces. Ensure focus management when navigating between steps. Provide clear visual indicators for the currently focused element.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test complete calculator flows using only keyboard navigation. Verify all interactive elements can be accessed and activated. Test focus management when navigating between steps. Ensure keyboard shortcuts work as expected.
