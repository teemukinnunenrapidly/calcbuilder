Future tasks should consider:\n\n1) Path aliases (@/) may not work reliably in Vercel builds - relative imports are more dependable for production deployments\n\n2) TypeScript and build dependencies must be in main dependencies section, not devDependencies, to ensure proper resolution during Vercel builds\n\n3) Auth pages with client-side hooks require dynamic rendering with `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent static generation errors\n\n4) Simplified Next.js configurations work better in production environments - avoid experimental features, custom webpack configurations, and complex output settings\n</info added on 2025-08-21T07:12:54.248Z>",
