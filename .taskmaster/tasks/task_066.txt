## 🎯 Description
Create a visual indicator showing the user's progress through the multi-step calculator

## 📝 Implementation Details
Design and implement a ProgressIndicator component that visually represents the user's position in the multi-step form. Show completed steps, current step, and upcoming steps. Support different visual styles (dots, numbers, labels). Make the component customizable through props for colors, sizes, and styles. Implement animations for transitions between steps. Ensure the component updates correctly when steps change or are completed.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test the ProgressIndicator with different configurations and step counts. Verify correct rendering in various states (first step, middle steps, last step). Test accessibility of the component with screen readers.
