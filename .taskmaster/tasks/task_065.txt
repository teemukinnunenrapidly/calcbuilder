# Task 65: Implement Multi-step Form Renderer

## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 65
- **Title**: Implement Multi-step Form Renderer
- **Status**: ⏳ pending
- **Priority**: 🔴 high
- **Dependencies**: Task 64 ⏳ Wait for dependencies

## 🎯 Description
Create the core component for rendering multi-step calculator forms with navigation controls

## 📝 Implementation Details
Develop a flexible form renderer component that can display calculator steps sequentially. Implement a FormRenderer component that accepts a calculator configuration and renders each step. Include navigation controls (previous/next buttons) and step indicators. The renderer should maintain form state across steps and handle validation before proceeding to the next step. Use React context to manage the form state globally. Implement a useFormState hook for components to access and update the form data.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Create unit tests for the FormRenderer component. Test navigation between steps, form state persistence, and validation behavior. Verify that the component correctly renders different types of form elements.
