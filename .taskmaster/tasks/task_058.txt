## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 58
- **Title**: Create Sample Data Generator
- **Status**: ⏳ pending
- **Priority**: 🟡 medium
- **Dependencies**: Task 57 ⏳ Wait for dependencies

## 🎯 Description
Develop a system for generating realistic sample data for testing calculators.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Implement a SampleDataGenerator component for creating and managing test data sets. Support various data types: Text (names, addresses, lorem ipsum), Numbers (integers, decimals, ranges), Dates (random, ranges, relative), Boolean values, Selection from lists, File placeholders. Create predefined data profiles for common testing scenarios. Add support for data relationships (e.g., consistent data across related fields). Implement data randomization with seeds for reproducibility. Create a data preview system. Add support for importing test data from CSV or JSON. Implement data generation rules based on field validation constraints. Create a test data library with common data sets.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test sample data generation for different field types. Verify that predefined data profiles work for common scenarios. Test data relationships across related fields. Verify that data randomization works with seeds for reproducibility. Test the data preview system. Verify that importing test data works from CSV and JSON. Test data generation rules with field validation constraints. Verify that the test data library provides useful data sets.
