# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Authentication with Supabase Auth
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up authentication system using Supabase Auth with email/password and social login options.
# Details:
Configure Supabase Auth with email/password authentication. Add social login providers (Google, GitHub) for convenience. Create React context for authentication state management. Implement protected routes using React Router. Create login, registration, password reset, and email verification pages. Implement JWT token handling and refresh logic. Create user profile management page. Set up role-based access control for different user types (Platform Administrator, Client Administrator) as defined in section 3 of the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration with email verification. Verify login functionality with both email/password and social providers. Test password reset flow. Verify protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login. Test token refresh mechanism. Verify role-based access control restricts access appropriately. Test user profile updates.
