## 🎯 Description
Create comprehensive database schema design for multi-tenant architecture

## 📝 Implementation Details
Design database schema with the following tables: 'companies' (id, name, slug, created_at, updated_at, settings JSONB), 'users' (id, email, company_id, role, created_at, updated_at), 'calculators' (id, company_id, name, config JSONB, created_at, updated_at), 'user_profiles' (id, user_id, first_name, last_name, avatar_url), 'company_invitations' (id, company_id, email, role, status, expires_at). Include foreign key relationships, indexes (especially on company_id and slug fields for performance), and constraints. Document schema with an ER diagram using a tool like dbdiagram.io. Consider partitioning strategy for large tables if needed. Implement proper timestamp handling with created_at and updated_at fields.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Review schema design with team for completeness. Validate foreign key relationships and constraints. Test schema with sample data to ensure it meets all requirements. Verify indexing strategy with EXPLAIN queries on expected access patterns.
