## 🎯 Description
Create a real-time preview component that shows how the form will appear to end-users as it's being built.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Develop a Preview component that renders the current form state as it would appear to end users. Implement a toggle mechanism to switch between builder and preview modes. Use React's context API to share form state between builder and preview components. Render each field type according to its configuration using a Field Renderer component. Apply styling that matches the final output. Make the preview responsive to different screen sizes using CSS media queries. Add a device selector to view the preview as it would appear on desktop, tablet, or mobile. Implement form navigation for multi-step forms in the preview. Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling to prevent style leakage between builder and preview.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test that the preview accurately reflects the current form structure. Verify that all field types render correctly in the preview. Test the preview on different screen sizes and with the device selector. Verify that multi-step navigation works in preview mode. Test that style changes in the builder are reflected in the preview. Verify that the preview is updated in real-time as changes are made in the builder.
