## 🎯 Description
Create a preview and test mode for live calculator testing with sample data.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Implement a PreviewMode component that renders the form as it would appear to end users. Create a test data generator for populating form fields. Add a step-by-step navigation system for multi-step forms. Implement real-time formula calculation in preview mode. Create a debug panel showing calculation steps and variable values. Add support for different test scenarios with predefined data sets. Implement form submission testing that shows the final output. Create a responsive preview that simulates different devices. Add performance monitoring in test mode. Implement user interaction recording for testing user flows.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test the preview mode with various form configurations. Verify that test data generation works for different field types. Test step-by-step navigation in multi-step forms. Verify that real-time formula calculation works in preview mode. Test the debug panel with complex calculations. Verify that test scenarios work with predefined data sets. Test form submission in preview mode. Verify that the responsive preview accurately simulates different devices. Test performance monitoring in complex forms. Verify that user interaction recording works for testing flows.
