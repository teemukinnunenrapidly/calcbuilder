# Task 43: Develop Formula Parser Engine

## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 43
- **Title**: Develop Formula Parser Engine
- **Status**: ⏳ pending
- **Priority**: 🔴 high
- **Dependencies**: None ✅ Ready to start

## 🎯 Description
Create a safe mathematical expression parser that can evaluate formulas with variable substitution.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Implement a formula parsing engine using a library like math.js (v11.8.0 or latest) for safe evaluation. Create a custom scope for variables that can be referenced in formulas. Implement sanitization of input formulas to prevent code injection. Support basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^). Add support for mathematical functions (sin, cos, tan, abs, round, floor, ceiling, etc.). Implement support for logical operators (AND, OR, NOT, >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=). Create a variable substitution mechanism that replaces field references with actual values. Implement error handling for invalid formulas. Add support for unit conversion (e.g., currency, length, weight). Cache parsed formulas for performance optimization. Create a formula validation function that checks syntax before saving.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Create unit tests for formula parsing with various mathematical expressions. Test variable substitution with different data types. Test error handling with invalid formulas. Test performance with complex formulas. Verify that the parser is secure against code injection attempts. Test all supported mathematical functions and operators. Verify that unit conversions work correctly.
