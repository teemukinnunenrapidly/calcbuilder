## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 40
- **Title**: Implement Field Library Component
- **Status**: ⏳ pending

## 🎯 Description
Create a component that displays all available field types that can be dragged onto the form canvas.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Develop a Field Library component that categorizes form fields into logical groups (e.g., Text Inputs, Selection Controls, Media Elements, etc.). Each field type should have an icon, name, and brief description. Implement a search functionality to filter field types. Use React context to manage the available field types. Each field should be represented as a draggable item using @dnd-kit hooks (useDraggable). Field types should include: Text Input, Number Input, Email, Phone, Date Picker, Time Picker, Select Dropdown, Multi-select, Checkbox, Radio Group, File Upload, Image Display, Text Area, Rating, Slider, Toggle Switch. Store field metadata in a configuration object that includes properties like type, default values, validation rules, and UI properties.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Unit test the Field Library component to ensure all field types are properly displayed. Test the search/filter functionality. Test that draggable items are properly configured with @dnd-kit. Verify that field metadata is correctly associated with each field type. Test accessibility of the field library component.
