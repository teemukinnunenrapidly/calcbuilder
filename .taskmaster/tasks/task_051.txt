## 🎯 Description
Develop a panel for configuring field properties, validation rules, and appearance.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Implement a FieldConfigPanel component that displays when a field is selected. Create sections for different configuration categories (basic properties, validation, appearance, advanced). Add controls for field properties (label, placeholder, help text, default value). Implement validation rule configuration (required, min/max length, pattern matching, custom validation). Create appearance settings (size, color, font, alignment). Add conditional logic configuration (show/hide based on other field values). Implement dependency settings between fields. Create advanced options like custom CSS classes and data attributes. Add support for field-specific settings based on field type. Implement a configuration history/undo feature.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test field configuration with various field types. Verify that all configuration categories work correctly. Test field property controls. Verify that validation rule configuration works as expected. Test appearance settings with different options. Verify that conditional logic configuration works correctly. Test dependency settings between fields. Verify that advanced options like custom CSS classes are applied. Test field-specific settings. Verify that the configuration history/undo feature works.
