# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Supabase Project and Database Schema
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Supabase project and implement the database schema as defined in the PRD.
# Details:
Create a new Supabase project with PostgreSQL database. Implement all tables defined in section 5.4 of the PRD including companies, calculators, form_sections, form_fields, shortcodes, visual_elements, leads, and email_templates. Set up proper relationships, constraints, and indexes. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) policies for proper data isolation between clients. Create database functions for common operations like calculator creation and lead generation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all tables are created with correct columns, relationships, and constraints. Test RLS policies to ensure data isolation between different companies. Run sample queries to validate relationships and constraints. Use Supabase's built-in SQL editor to test database functions with sample data.
