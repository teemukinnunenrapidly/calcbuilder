## 🎯 Description
Set up Sentry for error tracking and monitoring with GDPR-compliant configuration.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Create a Sentry.io account and project. Install Sentry SDK for the frontend and backend. Configure Sentry to be GDPR compliant by implementing IP anonymization, cookie consent integration, and user identification controls. Set up custom error boundaries in React components. Configure error grouping and environment separation (development, staging, production). Implement source maps uploading for better stack traces. Add custom context to errors for better debugging. Set up alert notifications for critical errors.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Verify Sentry captures frontend and backend errors correctly. Test that PII is properly anonymized in error reports. Confirm source maps are working by checking stack traces. Validate that error boundaries capture and report component errors. Test alert notifications are triggered appropriately.
