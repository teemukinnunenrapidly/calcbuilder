## 🎯 Description
Develop an intuitive visual editor for creating and editing formulas with field references.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Build a Formula Editor component with syntax highlighting using a library like CodeMirror (v6.0.0 or latest) or Monaco Editor. Implement autocomplete for field references and mathematical functions. Create a field reference picker that shows available fields that can be used in formulas. Add a formula testing panel that allows users to enter test values and see results. Implement error highlighting for invalid syntax. Add tooltips for functions and operators explaining their usage. Create a formula history/undo feature. Implement a simple mode for basic formulas and an advanced mode for complex expressions. Use React context to share the formula state with other components. Add a formula library with common templates that users can start from.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test syntax highlighting for different formula components. Verify that autocomplete works for fields and functions. Test the field reference picker to ensure it shows all available fields. Verify that the formula testing panel correctly evaluates expressions. Test error highlighting with various syntax errors. Verify that tooltips provide accurate information. Test the formula history/undo feature. Verify that both simple and advanced modes work correctly.
