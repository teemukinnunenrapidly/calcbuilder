# Task ID: 24
# Title: Setup Production Deployment Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up production deployment infrastructure on Vercel for Next.js application with Supabase backend.
# Details:
Create Vercel project and connect GitHub repository for automatic deployments. Configure production environment variables including Supabase credentials, Resend API key, and other service keys. Set up custom domain with proper DNS configuration. Configure deployment settings for Next.js with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for calculator pages. Set up production and preview branches (main for production, develop for staging). Configure Vercel Analytics and Web Vitals monitoring. Set up Edge Functions for API routes optimization. Configure regional deployment to EU (Frankfurt/Paris) for GDPR compliance. Set up Vercel KV for session storage if needed. Configure build optimization with proper caching strategies. Set up environment variable management for different environments (development, preview, production). Configure Vercel Firewall rules for DDoS protection. Implement proper error pages (404, 500). Set up Vercel Speed Insights. Configure OG image generation for social sharing. Set up webhook notifications for deployment status to Slack/Discord.

# Test Strategy:
Verify GitHub integration triggers automatic deployments on push to main branch. Test environment variables are correctly set and accessible in production. Verify custom domain resolves correctly with SSL. Test ISR works for calculator pages with proper revalidation. Confirm preview deployments work for pull requests. Verify Analytics and Web Vitals data collection. Test Edge Functions respond with low latency from EU regions. Verify GDPR-compliant data processing in EU region. Test error pages display correctly. Verify build caching reduces deployment time. Test rollback functionality works. Confirm webhook notifications fire on deployment events. Test API rate limiting works correctly. Verify OG images generate properly for social shares.
