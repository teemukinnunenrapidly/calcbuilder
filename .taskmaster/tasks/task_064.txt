- **Status**: ⏳ pending

## 🎯 Description
Set up a separate React application bundle for the end-user calculator interface

## 📝 Implementation Details
Initialize a new React application structure that will serve as the public-facing calculator. This should be separate from the admin/builder interface. Configure webpack to create an optimized bundle specifically for end-users. Set up the basic folder structure including components, hooks, contexts, and utilities. Configure the build process to generate both development and production builds. Ensure the bundle size is optimized using code splitting and lazy loading where appropriate.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Verify the build process completes successfully. Check bundle size and load time metrics. Ensure the application initializes correctly in a test environment.
