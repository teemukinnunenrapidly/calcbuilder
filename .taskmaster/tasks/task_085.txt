# Task 85: Implement Core Calculator Renderer

## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 85
- **Title**: Implement Core Calculator Renderer
- **Status**: ⏳ pending
- **Priority**: 🔴 high
- **Dependencies**: Task 84 ⏳ Wait for dependencies

## 🎯 Description
Create the main calculator component that handles multi-step form display with progress indicators and navigation controls.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Develop a Calculator component that accepts configuration from the backend and renders the appropriate form steps. Implement a state management solution (Context API or Redux) to track user progress through the calculator. Create components for progress indicators (e.g., step numbers, progress bar) and navigation controls (previous/next buttons). Handle form state persistence between steps.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Unit test the Calculator component with various configurations. Test navigation between steps, state persistence, and proper rendering of different form elements. Verify progress indicators update correctly.
