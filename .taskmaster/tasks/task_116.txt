## 🎯 Description
Set up SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS connections with automatic renewal.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Use Let's Encrypt for free, automated SSL certificates. Implement Certbot or similar tool for certificate issuance and renewal. Configure web server (Nginx/Apache) for SSL termination. Set up automatic renewal via cron jobs. Implement OCSP stapling for improved performance. Configure proper cipher suites for security and compatibility. Set up HTTP to HTTPS redirection. Implement certificate monitoring and alerting for expiration. Document SSL configuration and renewal process.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test SSL configuration using SSL Labs and other security scanners. Verify certificate renewal process works automatically. Test HTTPS redirection from HTTP URLs. Validate HSTS is working correctly. Ensure certificates are properly trusted across browsers.
