## 🎯 Description
Create endpoints and UI for users to request data export and account deletion in compliance with GDPR requirements.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Develop API endpoints for data export (/api/user/export) and deletion (/api/user/delete). Create a user settings page with options to download personal data and delete account. For data export, compile all user data into a structured JSON file. For deletion, implement a two-step confirmation process and schedule a soft delete followed by hard delete after retention period. Include email notifications for both actions. Document the process for handling manual requests.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Create automated tests for both endpoints. Verify exported data contains all required information. Test the deletion flow including confirmation emails. Ensure deleted accounts cannot be accessed after the process completes. Validate against GDPR compliance checklist.
