## 🎯 Description
Create a GDPR-compliant cookie consent banner that allows users to accept/reject cookies and manage their preferences.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Develop a cookie consent mechanism that appears on first visit and stores user preferences. Implement using a lightweight solution like 'cookie-consent' or 'gdpr-cookie-consent' libraries. The banner should include options for necessary cookies, analytics, and marketing. Store consent in localStorage with expiration. Ensure the banner is accessible and works across all devices. Include a privacy policy link and allow users to change preferences later.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test across browsers and devices to ensure the banner appears correctly. Verify that preferences are stored correctly and honored across the site. Ensure the banner reappears when consent expires. Validate against GDPR requirements checklist.
