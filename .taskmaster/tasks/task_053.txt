# Task 53: Develop Conditional Logic System

## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 53
- **Title**: Develop Conditional Logic System
- **Status**: ⏳ pending
- **Priority**: 🔴 high
- **Dependencies**: Task 43, Task 51 ⏳ Wait for dependencies

## 🎯 Description
Create a system for defining conditional logic to show/hide fields based on other field values.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Implement a ConditionalLogicBuilder component for creating and editing conditions. Support various condition types: Equals, Not equals, Contains, Does not contain, Greater than, Less than, Is empty, Is not empty. Create a condition group system with AND/OR logic. Implement a visual condition builder with drag-and-drop support. Add a condition testing panel with sample data. Create a dependency graph to visualize relationships between fields. Implement condition evaluation using the formula parser engine. Add support for complex nested conditions. Create a condition library with common presets. Implement performance optimization for condition evaluation.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test conditional logic creation and editing. Verify that all condition types work correctly. Test condition groups with AND/OR logic. Verify that the visual condition builder works with drag-and-drop. Test the condition testing panel with sample data. Verify that the dependency graph correctly visualizes relationships. Test condition evaluation with various field values. Verify that complex nested conditions work correctly. Test the condition library presets. Verify performance with many conditions.
