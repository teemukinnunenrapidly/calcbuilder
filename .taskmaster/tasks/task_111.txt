## 🎯 Description
Configure a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for serving static assets to improve loading performance.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Select an appropriate CDN provider (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront). Configure the CDN to serve static assets (images, CSS, JS) from optimized edge locations. Set up proper cache headers for different asset types. Implement cache busting using content hashing in filenames. Configure CORS headers for CDN resources. Set up image optimization pipeline for CDN-served images. Implement HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 for improved delivery. Configure DNS settings for the CDN. Set up monitoring for CDN performance.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test CDN performance from different geographic locations. Verify cache headers are correctly set. Confirm assets are being served from CDN rather than origin. Test cache invalidation process. Measure load time improvements using Lighthouse and WebPageTest.
