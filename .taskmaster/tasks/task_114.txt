Select an uptime monitoring service (e.g., UptimeRobot, Pingdom, or StatusCake). Configure monitoring for critical endpoints and services. Set up alerting via email, SMS, and Slack for downtime. Implement status page for transparency. Configure synthetic monitoring for key user flows. Set up response time tracking and alerting for performance degradation. Implement multi-region checks for global availability monitoring. Document incident response procedures for downtime alerts.
