## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 41
- **Title**: Create Form Canvas with Section Management
- **Status**: ⏳ pending

## 🎯 Description
Develop the main form canvas area where fields can be dropped and organized into sections.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Implement a Form Canvas component that serves as the drop target for fields from the library. Create a Section component that can contain multiple form fields. Sections should be collapsible, reorderable, and have customizable titles. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive layout of the form canvas. Implement the useDroppable hook from @dnd-kit for drop zones. Create a form state management system using React context or Redux to track the structure of the form (sections and their fields). Add functionality to add, remove, and reorder sections. Implement a JSON schema representation of the form structure that can be saved to the database. Use React.memo or useMemo to optimize rendering performance for complex forms.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test dropping fields onto the canvas from the field library. Verify that sections can be added, removed, and reordered. Test collapsing and expanding sections. Verify that the form state is correctly updated when modifications are made. Test the JSON schema generation for accuracy. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes. Verify that the canvas handles a large number of fields efficiently.
