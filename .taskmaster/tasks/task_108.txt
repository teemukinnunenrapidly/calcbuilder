# Task 108: Implement Rate Limiting

## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 108
- **Title**: Implement Rate Limiting
- **Status**: ⏳ pending
- **Priority**: 🟡 medium
- **Dependencies**: None ✅ Ready to start

## 🎯 Description
Add rate limiting to API endpoints to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Implement rate limiting middleware using a library like express-rate-limit for Node.js applications. Configure different rate limits for various endpoints based on sensitivity (e.g., stricter limits for authentication endpoints). Use Redis for distributed rate limiting if running multiple instances. Add appropriate response headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset). Implement progressive rate limiting with increasing timeouts for repeated violations. Log rate limit violations for monitoring.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test rate limiting by making rapid sequential requests to endpoints. Verify correct HTTP 429 responses when limits are exceeded. Test rate limit reset functionality. Ensure rate limiting works correctly in a distributed environment if applicable.
