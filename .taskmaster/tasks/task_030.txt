## 🎯 Description
Create functionality for deactivating and deleting user accounts with confirmation dialogs

## 📝 Implementation Details
Implement user deactivation toggle using shadcn/ui Switch. Create deletion functionality with confirmation dialog using shadcn/ui AlertDialog. Add soft delete option that preserves user data but prevents login. Implement permanent deletion with additional confirmation. Create batch actions for multiple user selection. Add audit logging for account changes. Implement undo functionality for recent deactivations. Create success/error notifications using shadcn/ui Toast. Handle edge cases like preventing self-deletion for admin users.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test deactivation toggle correctly updates user status. Verify confirmation dialogs appear before deletion. Test batch actions work on multiple selected users. Verify audit logging records account changes. Test undo functionality for recent deactivations. Verify admins cannot delete their own accounts.
