# Task 8: Implement Role-Based Access Control

## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 8
- **Title**: Implement Role-Based Access Control
- **Status**: ⏳ pending
- **Priority**: 🟡 medium
- **Dependencies**: Task 5, Task 7 ⏳ Wait for dependencies

## 🎯 Description
Create RBAC system for different user permission levels

## 📝 Implementation Details
Define role enum in database (admin, member, readonly). Create permissions table mapping roles to specific actions. Implement RLS policies in database based on user role. Create middleware for checking permissions on API routes. Implement helper functions for permission checking (canUserDoAction). Create UI components for conditional rendering based on permissions. Document role system and permissions in README.md. Consider implementing a more granular permission system if needed for future scalability.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test each role with various actions to verify correct permissions. Verify RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access. Test API endpoints with different user roles. Verify UI components correctly show/hide based on permissions. Test edge cases like role changes and session expiration.
