# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Visual Formula Editor
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the visual formula editor with shortcode system as specified in section 4.2.
# Details:
Implement drag-and-drop formula components using @dnd-kit. Create visual representation of mathematical operations. Implement variable picker to select form fields. Create components for all available functions: basic math, conditionals, comparisons, rounding, financial, and statistical. Implement real-time formula preview with test values. Create formula validation to prevent syntax errors. Implement shortcode management system for storing and retrieving formulas.

# Test Strategy:
Test creating formulas with different operations and functions. Verify variables can be selected from form fields. Test real-time preview with different test values. Verify formula validation catches syntax errors. Test saving and loading formulas as shortcodes. Verify complex formulas with nested operations work correctly.
