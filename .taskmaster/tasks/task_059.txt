Implement trigger actions for visual elements (show, hide, animate, style change). Add support for trigger chaining and sequences. Create a trigger testing panel with sample data. Implement trigger logging for debugging. Add performance optimization for trigger evaluation. Create a trigger library with common presets. Implement trigger analytics to track which triggers are activated most often.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test trigger creation and management for visual elements. Verify that all trigger types work correctly. Test the visual trigger builder with condition configuration. Verify that trigger actions work for visual elements. Test trigger chaining and sequences. Verify that the trigger testing panel works with sample data. Test trigger logging for debugging purposes. Verify performance with many triggers. Test the trigger library presets. Verify that trigger analytics correctly track activations.
