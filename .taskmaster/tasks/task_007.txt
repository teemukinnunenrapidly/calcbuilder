# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Drag-and-Drop Form Builder
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the drag-and-drop interface for building calculator forms as specified in section 4.1.
# Details:
Implement drag-and-drop functionality using @dnd-kit library. Create components for all field types: number inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, sliders, date pickers, text inputs, and buttons. Implement field configuration panel for setting labels, placeholders, validation rules, conditional visibility, help text, and required/optional settings. Create form section management for organizing fields into logical groups. Implement real-time preview of the form being built. Add undo/redo functionality for form editing actions.

# Test Strategy:
Test dragging and dropping different field types onto the form canvas. Verify field configuration options work correctly. Test conditional visibility rules. Verify form sections can be created, edited, and reordered. Test the real-time preview updates as changes are made. Verify undo/redo functionality works for all form editing actions. Test accessibility of the form builder interface.
