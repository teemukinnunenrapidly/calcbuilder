# Task 3: Create Docker Development Environment

## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 3
- **Title**: Create Docker Development Environment
- **Status**: ⏳ pending
- **Priority**: 🔴 high
- **Dependencies**: Task 2 ⏳ Wait for dependencies

## 🎯 Description
Set up Docker and docker-compose for local development environment

## 📝 Implementation Details
Create a docker-compose.yml file that includes services for: Supabase (using the official Supabase Docker image v1.0+), PostgreSQL (v15+), and any other required services. Configure volume mounts for persistent data. Set up environment variables in a .env file (with a .env.example template for documentation). Create a Dockerfile for the application with Node.js 18+ as the base image. Configure Docker networking to allow services to communicate. Add Docker-specific npm scripts to package.json for starting/stopping the environment. Document Docker setup in README.md with clear instructions for getting started.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test Docker environment by running `docker-compose up` and verifying all services start correctly. Confirm database connectivity from application container. Verify volume persistence by restarting containers and checking if data remains. Test environment variables are properly loaded.
