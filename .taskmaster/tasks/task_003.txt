# Task ID: 3
# Title: Setup Docker and Docker Compose for Development
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Docker and Docker Compose configuration for local development environment.
# Details:
Create a Dockerfile for the application based on Node.js image. Set up Docker Compose with services for the frontend application, Supabase local development, and any other required services. Configure environment variables for development. Set up volume mappings for code hot-reloading. Configure networking between containers. Include Nginx as reverse proxy as specified in section 5.3 of the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Docker containers start successfully with docker-compose up. Ensure all services can communicate with each other. Test hot-reloading functionality by making changes to the code. Verify Nginx reverse proxy correctly routes requests to the appropriate services.
