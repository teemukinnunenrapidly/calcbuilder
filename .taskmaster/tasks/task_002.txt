# Task ID: 2
# Title: Setup React Project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a new React project with TypeScript and configure Tailwind CSS as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Create a new React project using Vite or Next.js. Configure TypeScript with strict type checking. Install and configure Tailwind CSS with the color palette and design tokens from section 17.5. Set up shadcn/ui components following the documentation verification protocol in section 17.10. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Set up directory structure following best practices for component organization. Install required dependencies: React Hook Form, Zod, @dnd-kit, Tremor, react-i18next, and Plausible analytics.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the project builds without errors. Test that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured by applying some utility classes. Ensure shadcn/ui components render correctly. Validate TypeScript configuration by intentionally introducing type errors and confirming they're caught. Test that all required dependencies are correctly installed and can be imported.
