## 🎯 Description
Optimize the calculator interface for performance, focusing on load time, interactivity, and resource usage.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Implement code splitting to reduce initial bundle size. Optimize asset loading with appropriate preloading and lazy loading. Implement memoization for expensive calculations. Optimize rendering performance with React.memo and useMemo. Set up performance monitoring with web vitals tracking.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Measure performance metrics (FCP, LCP, TTI, CLS) before and after optimization. Test on low-end devices and slow network connections. Verify bundle size reduction.
