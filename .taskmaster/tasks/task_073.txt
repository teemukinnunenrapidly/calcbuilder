## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 73
- **Title**: Create Translation Files for Core Languages
- **Status**: ⏳ pending

## 🎯 Description
Develop translation files for at least 3 languages as specified in the requirements

## 📝 Implementation Details
Create JSON translation files for at least 3 languages (e.g., English, Spanish, French). Structure the translation keys logically by feature or component. Include translations for all user-facing text in the calculator interface. Add metadata like language name, direction (LTR/RTL), and locale information. Implement a process for maintaining and updating translations. Consider using a translation management system for larger projects.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Verify all user-facing text is translated in each language. Test RTL language support if applicable. Check for missing translations or formatting issues. Have native speakers review translations for accuracy if possible.
