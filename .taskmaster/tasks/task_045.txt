# Task 45: Implement Variable Selection System

## 📋 Task Information
- **ID**: 45
- **Title**: Implement Variable Selection System
- **Status**: ⏳ pending
- **Priority**: 🔴 high
- **Dependencies**: Task 41, Task 44 ⏳ Wait for dependencies

## 🎯 Description
Create a system for selecting and referencing form fields as variables in formulas.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Develop a VariableSelector component that displays all available fields that can be used in formulas. Implement a search/filter functionality to find fields by name or type. Create a mechanism to insert field references into the formula editor. Generate unique identifiers for each field that can be used in formulas. Implement a visual indicator in the form builder showing which fields are used in formulas. Create a dependency graph to track relationships between fields and formulas. Add validation to prevent circular references in formulas. Implement a system to handle field renaming that updates all formula references. Use React context to share the available variables across components.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test the variable selector to ensure it displays all available fields. Verify that search/filter functionality works correctly. Test inserting field references into the formula editor. Verify that unique identifiers are generated consistently. Test the visual indicators for fields used in formulas. Verify that the dependency graph correctly tracks relationships. Test circular reference detection. Verify that field renaming updates all formula references.
