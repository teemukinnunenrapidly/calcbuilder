## 🎯 Description
Create responsive layouts for the calculator that adapt to different screen sizes

## 📝 Implementation Details
Implement a responsive grid system using CSS Grid and/or Flexbox. Create breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Design the calculator layout to reflow appropriately at each breakpoint. Use CSS media queries to adjust component sizes, spacing, and positioning. Implement a mobile-first approach, starting with the smallest screen size and progressively enhancing for larger screens. Create utility components like Container, Row, and Column to facilitate responsive layouts.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Test the responsive behavior across multiple device sizes using Playwright. Verify layout integrity at standard breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px). Ensure no horizontal scrolling occurs on mobile devices.
