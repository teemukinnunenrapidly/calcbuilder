## 🎯 Description
Integrate and configure @dnd-kit library to enable drag-and-drop functionality for the form builder component.

## 📝 Implementation Details
Install @dnd-kit/core (v6.0.8 or latest) and @dnd-kit/sortable (v7.0.2 or latest) packages. Create a DragContext provider component that will wrap the form builder. Implement the DragOverlay, useSortable, and DndContext components from the library. Configure sensors for mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions. Set up collision detection algorithms (rectIntersection is recommended for form building). Create custom drag handles for form elements. Implement drop zones for different sections of the form. Add animations for drag start, drag end, and drop events using CSS transitions or @dnd-kit/animation package.

## 🧪 Test Strategy
Create unit tests for drag and drop functionality using React Testing Library. Test dragging fields from the library to the form canvas. Test reordering of fields within a section. Test moving fields between different sections. Verify proper state updates after drag operations. Test keyboard accessibility for drag operations. Test touch interactions on mobile devices.
