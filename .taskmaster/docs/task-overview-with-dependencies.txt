## üö® HIGH COMPLEXITY TASKS (Require Special Attention)

1. **Task 2**: Setup TypeScript Project Configuration (Difficulty: 8) - ‚úÖ Ready to start
2. **Task 3**: Create Docker Development Environment (Difficulty: 9) - ‚è≥ Wait for Task 2
3. **Task 43**: Develop Formula Parser Engine (Difficulty: 8) - ‚úÖ Ready to start
4. **Task 72**: Implement WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Compliance (Difficulty: 8) - ‚è≥ Wait for UI components
5. **Task 85**: Implement Security Protections (Difficulty: 8) - ‚úÖ Ready to start
6. **Task 95**: Conduct Security Penetration Testing (Difficulty: 8) - ‚è≥ Wait for security setup

## üí° IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Ready to Start Tasks)**
- Begin with the 16 tasks that have no dependencies
- Focus on infrastructure and core setup
- Establish development patterns and standards

### **Phase 2: Core Development (Dependency-Based)**
- Follow dependency chains logically
- Work on parallel sections simultaneously
- Maintain consistent development velocity

### **Phase 3: Integration & Testing**
- Complete end-to-end testing tasks
- Ensure all components work together
- Validate security and compliance requirements

## üìã CURRENT STATUS OVERVIEW

**All 108 tasks are currently in "pending" status**
- **Ready to start**: 16 tasks (15%)
- **Dependencies required**: 92 tasks (85%)
- **Critical path**: Focus on foundation tasks first to unlock dependent tasks
