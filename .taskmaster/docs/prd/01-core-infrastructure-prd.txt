Part 1: Core Infrastructure & Database Foundation
Description: Establish the foundational database architecture, authentication system, and multi-tenant infrastructure that all other components will build upon.
Core Features:

PostgreSQL/Supabase Database Setup - Complete schema with companies, calculators, users tables
Multi-Tenant Architecture - Company isolation, data separation, slug-based routing
Authentication System - User registration, login, JWT tokens, role-based access
API Foundation - REST endpoints, Edge Functions setup, rate limiting
Core Data Models - TypeScript interfaces, Zod schemas, validation rules
Storage Configuration - File upload system for images, logos, documents
Real-time Subscriptions - WebSocket connections for live updates

Technical Implementation:

Supabase Project Setup - Initialize project, configure auth providers, set up RLS policies
Database Migrations - Create all core tables, indexes, stored procedures
TypeScript Configuration - Set up types, interfaces, API client
Docker Environment - Local development setup with docker-compose

Dependencies:

None (this is the foundation layer)

Testing Strategy:
Database migration tests, authentication flow testing, API endpoint validation, and multi-tenant data isolation verification.
Success Criteria:

All database tables created and indexed
Authentication working with email/password
API responding to basic CRUD operations
Multi-tenant data isolation confirmed
File upload/storage operational
